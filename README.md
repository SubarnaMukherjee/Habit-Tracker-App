# Habit-Tracker-App
React app to start tracking habits for next seven days. we can add, delete and change status of each habit for a day. All habits are stored in localStorage so no worries about getting habits lost. Implement state using redux-toolkit and styled components using react-bootstrap. And always no login/signup to keep simple and quick enough.
